Personal vocabulary builder

## Inspiration ##
Vocabulary has always been a weakness throughout years of school.  It has
never been terrible, and I certainly was able to cram for the SAT reading
section very well.  However, it has never been satisfactory.

The most difficult part of improving my vocabulary is the amount of overhead I
needed to do in order to just learn new words.  I've tried multiple vocabulary
building application, but they were all focused on training vocabulary for
exams or particular professions. It seems that there's extra, unnecessary
effort required just to pick up foreign words you read everyday.

**Lex** is meant to fulfill that need (for me personally, anyway).  It takes
usability inspiration from [Google Dictionary][gd] Chrome plugin, but it also
stores the words you look up, thus building a personal vocabulary list from
scratch very easily.  I believe, because the words chosen are from your
personal readings, the context will greatly affect your memory of the words.
