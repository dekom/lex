# LeX #
Personal vocabulary builder

## Inspiration ##
Vocabulary has always been a weakness throughout years of school.  It has
never been terrible, and I certainly was able to cram for the SAT reading
section very well.  However, it has never been satisfactory.

The most difficult part of improving my vocabulary is the amount of overhead I
needed to do in order to just learn new words.  I've tried multiple vocabulary
building application, but they were all focused on training vocabulary for
exams or particular professions. It seems that there's extra, unnecessary
effort required just to pick up foreign words you read everyday.

**Lex** is meant to fulfill that need (for me personally, anyway).  It takes
usability inspiration from [Google Dictionary][gd] Chrome plugin, but it also
stores the words you look up, thus building a personal vocabulary list from
scratch very easily.  I believe, because the words chosen are from your
personal readings, the context will greatly affect your memory of the words.

### User Story ###
To illustrate certain functions, consider the following mock user story.

Dan is browsing a NYT article online.  He finds words whose meaning he does
not know.  He double clicks on the word and a dictionary entry appears around
the word.  The word is automatically saved to his LeX account.  He repeats the
process for the rest of the article.  When he visits his LeX account, he'll
see a list of words taken from the article, along with the context in which
the words appeared, and other information related to the word (definition,
parts of speech, pronunciations, etc.).  He can tag them into separate groups.
He can ask to be quizzed - flash cards or other methods.
